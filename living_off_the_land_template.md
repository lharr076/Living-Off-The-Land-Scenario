# Threat Event (Living Off The Land)
** Task Scheduler Persistence(Living off the Land)**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Gained intial access(simulated) and downloaded malicious file called `themachine.html`
2. Once the download is complete, the file then executes a `PowerShell` script
3. Persistence is kept with an initial PowerShell script to create a task in `Task Scheduler` at logon 
4. Execution is triggered two minutes after logon and opens notepad with a message `Hello my son Welcome to the machine`
